PRO aviris_create_apply_mask_batch
;This code utlizes the masking_with_tiles function to mask out the margins.
;This code uses the function to create and apply a mask for AVIRIS imagery,
;specifically the HyspIRI simulated dataset
;which does not contain a single value in the margin, but instead spectrum that is residue
;from atmospheric correction processes.
;It out puts an ENVI file in the same directory with the ending 'mask'
;This code uses new ENVI (NOT CLASSIC)
